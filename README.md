## Project Description

This project presents a novel methodology for enhancing power system resilience during critical failures, such as those seen during the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster. The approach addresses the challenge of power grid infeasibility during crises by leveraging infeasibility currentsâ€”a theoretical concept that prioritizes critical nodes in the power system under extreme stress. This prioritization is further refined through sparsity principles, ensuring efficient resource allocation to maintain functionality in essential areas while reducing overall energy inefficiencies.

The methodology integrates a LASSO-inspired optimization framework that combines L2 and L1 regularization to enhance sparsity in power distribution. By employing advanced optimization techniques and incorporating real-world constraints like voltage stability, the approach achieves strategic power restoration with reduced operational complexity. The project utilizes the IEEE case14 model for simulation, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to unbalanced systems effectively. This work provides a scalable and adaptable solution to power distribution challenges in disaster-stricken or resource-constrained scenarios.
